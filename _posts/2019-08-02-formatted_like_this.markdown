"The Second Project and the Troubles"


So when I had started my second project using Sinatra and building an MVC app, it was, at first, a bit difficult. Only being able to somewhat learn the concepts, mechanics, and syntax and only JUST starting to take notes down about my work, creating the app was definitely a challenge. Creating my models, views, and controllers were not exactly hard but the main thing that got me into trouble more than once was the fact that tiny mistakes plagued my work yet again and it forced me more than once to restart my work.

I was lucky enough to find the Corneal gem which made my life so much easier to create the skeleton I needed for the app. After recreating my website with some slight improvements hear and there I tried to run shotgun and enter my new app but there was a moment where every time I signed in, it would just bring me back to my sign in page. Apparently the username and password was not being saved into my database so I went into detective mode, as most coders do I now realized, to find this one singular bug. To my combined surprise, jubilation, and anger, I found that in the form action line, I had put sign in when it was supposed to be sign up. I immediately changed it and everything then seemed to work, thank god. 

If there is anything anyone of my cohort can tell any new aspiring developers about this profession is that you will be playing detective alot of times to find any and all bugs to your code. Some may be big, some may be small and for me, its the smaller ones that give the bigger headaches than the former.
