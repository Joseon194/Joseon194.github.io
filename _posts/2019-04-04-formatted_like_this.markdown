**Putting My Foot Through the Door** 

So it has been close to a month since I began the program and although I have been chugging along with the material theres always been that uncertainty with myself. I suppose it comes from the fact that I am trying and learning something that im only faintly familiar with but is still so alien to me that there are times that I have no idea what I'm looking at. Coming from a history degree background, looking at something like code is almost like me trying to read German. I love what I am doing right now. The satisfaction you receive when figuring out an error or creating a solution is so pure that it just makes me want to go and delve in further. While at the moment I am just learning Ruby right now, I am eager to learn more and all that Flatiron has to offer.
